The compiler uses a small typed intermediate representation between semantic analysis and code generation. The IR makes addresses, values, storage, calls, and runtime operations explicit while remaining much smaller than LLVM IR.

## Backend

The backend targets QBE.

QBE provides:

* instruction selection
* register allocation
* calling conventions
* native code generation

The compiler is responsible for language semantics, object layout, runtime checks, and lowering to QBE IL.

## Runtime

A small C runtime provides:

* memory allocation
* module initialization
* runtime checks
* basic runtime support
* standard library implementation

The runtime intentionally remains minimal.

## Garbage Collection

Heap allocation uses the Boehm–Demers–Weiser conservative garbage collector (BDWGC).

Generated code allocates through runtime wrappers rather than calling BDWGC directly:

* `oberon_alloc`
* `oberon_alloc_atomic`

This isolates the compiler from the underlying allocator and allows the GC implementation to be replaced in the future if desired.
